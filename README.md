LangtonsAnt
===========

Runs Langton's Ant with options for 3 color schemes with rule_strings up to length 12.
During the sim, holding the up or down arrow key increases/decreases the max_frame rate,
SPACEBAR pauses and the "d" key toggles the cells being drawn to the screen (not drawing
allows the code to run much faster). "Tail" mode only draws the most recently visited cells
where tail length is the number of recent cells to be drawn.
